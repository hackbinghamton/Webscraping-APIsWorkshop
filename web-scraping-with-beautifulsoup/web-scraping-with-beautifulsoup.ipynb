    "## How Web Scraping Works\n",
    "Web scraping allows you to get data from a website in the case that it doesn't have an API. It involves systematically searching websites' HTML for data of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "`BeautifulSoup` is a Python library that allows users to easily parse through HTML documents in search for data. In this piece, we'll scrape a simple webpage for some text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML Structure\n",
    "In order to understand how to webscrape, it's important to understand the structure of HTML documents. When you view a webpage, your browser is sending a request to the website and receiving an HTML file in return. Your browser then interprets the HTML for you and displays it to you in a human-readable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every piece of information in an HTML document resides inside of an *element*. These elements come as `<div>`s, `<p>`s, `<tr>`s, and many more, and they're all nested within each other inside of HTML documents. The arragement of these elements as well as their individual properties tell the browser how to display them to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, *we're not interested in the way the webpage looks* -- we're interested in the text data within each element, because that data is what we're trying to scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some example HTML for a simple website (about web scraping):\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Web Scraping</title>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <h1>Web Scraping in Python</h1>\n",
    "        \n",
    "        <div id=\"requirements\">\n",
    "            <h2>Requirements:</h1>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Finding What to Scrape\n",
    "Looking at the example HTML and the corresponding screenshot, it's fairly easy to pick out where in the HTML each piece of text comes from. *This isn't the case most of the time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, larger websites will have hundreds of elements on a single page, were most of the elements don't actually do anything except hold other elements. They'll have horrible, unintuitive names and reading the HTML itself won't get you very far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter *Inspect Element*. This tool lets you look through every element on a webpage. To access it, right click on any part of a webpage and select *Inspect Element*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's say that we decided to scrape from this webpage the names of every requirement.**\n",
    "\n",
    "By hovering over different elements in the *Inspector* pane, we can highlight what sections of the webpage they relate to. In the case of this website, we can see that the requirements we're trying to scrape are all found in the `div` element with `id=\"requirements\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example Page with Inspector](img/inspector.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that the `<div>` element with `id=\"requirements\"` gives us almost everything we need to start scraping -- yet, we need a little bit more information on how to filter down to *just* the requirements elements themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back at the HTML, we can see that the *Requirements* `<div>` holds a `<h1>` header element as well as three `<p>` elements. These `<p>` elements contain the data we're trying to scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we're ready to scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Scrape\n",
    "With `BeautifulSoup` we can scrape this above webpage and pick out particular information about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main steps to scraping: loading the HTML and searching it. First, we must *load* the HTML into a `BeautifulSoup` parser and then *search* the HTML with the parser to find where our data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Loading the HTML\n",
    "For the purposes of this demo, we'll have already stored the HTML as a string in a variable (`html_text`). Usually, you'd use a `requests` call to get the HTTP response from your target website, then use the response's `.text` instance variable to get the HTML as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we'll create a `BeautifulSoup` parser object that we'll use to scrape with."
