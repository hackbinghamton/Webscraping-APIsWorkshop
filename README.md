# HackBU - Web Scraping and APIs Workshop

## Getting Started

In this workshop, you'll learn how to work with data from the web! You'll use the `requests` library to get access to both APIs (for readily prepared data) and HTML webpages (for web scraping), and scrape the web with Beautiful Soup.

For this workshop, you will need to have a basic understanding of Python. This workshop covers material for both beginners and Advanced python users. 

Today's workshop covers:
1. [JSON](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/Webscraping-APIsWorkshop/blob/master/APIs/JSON.ipynb)
2. [The Requests Library](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/Webscraping-APIsWorkshop/blob/master/APIs/Requests.ipynb)
3. [APIs](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/Webscraping-APIsWorkshop/blob/master/APIs/APIs.ipynb)
