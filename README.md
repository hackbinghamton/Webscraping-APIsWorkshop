# HackBU - Web Scraping and APIs Workshop

## Getting Started

In this workshop, you'll learn how to work with data from the web! You'll use the `requests` library to get access to both APIs (for readily prepared data) and HTML webpages (for web scraping), and scrape the web with Beautiful Soup.

Today's workshop covers:
1. [JSON](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/Webscraping-APIsWorkshop/blob/master/APIs/JSON.ipynb)
2. [The Requests Library](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/Webscraping-APIsWorkshop/blob/master/APIs/Requests.ipynb)
3. [APIs](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/Webscraping-APIsWorkshop/blob/master/APIs/APIs.ipynb)
